# React Intro

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs) where you want a seamless, dynamic experience without reloading the page. It’s maintained by Facebook and a large community of developers. 

Here’s a quick intro:

### Key Concepts:

1. **Components**: 
   React apps are built using components, which are reusable pieces of UI. You can think of components as functions that return HTML. Components can be **functional** or **class-based**.

   - **Functional Components**: Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
     ```javascript
     function Welcome() {
       return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
     }
     ```
   - **Class Components**: More complex, used before React 16.8 introduced hooks.
     ```javascript
     class Welcome extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
       }
     }
     ```

2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**:
   React uses JSX, which looks like HTML, but it’s really JavaScript under the hood. It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.

   ```javascript
   const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
   ```

3. **Props (Properties)**:
   Props allow you to pass data from one component to another, like arguments to a function.
   ```javascript
   function Welcome(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
   }

   <Welcome name="John" />
   ```

4. **State**:
   State is an object that holds dynamic data in a component. It’s similar to variables but is managed within the component, and when state changes, the UI re-renders.
   - **Functional components with hooks (like `useState`)**:
     ```javascript
     import React, { useState } from 'react';

     function Counter() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
             Click me
           </button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

5. **Lifecycle Methods** (for class components):
   React class components come with lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` for handling side effects and cleanup.

6. **Hooks**:
   Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to add state and other React features to functional components. Some commonly used hooks are:
   - `useState`: For managing state in functional components.
   - `useEffect`: For handling side effects like fetching data or updating the DOM.
   - `useContext`: For passing data through component trees without props.
   
   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

   useEffect(() => {
     // Runs after every render
     console.log("Component rendered");
   });
   ```

7. **Virtual DOM**:
   React keeps a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM called the Virtual DOM. When the state changes, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it with the actual DOM (using a diffing algorithm), and efficiently updates only the changed parts.

8. **One-Way Data Flow**:
   Data in React flows in one direction, from parent to child components via props, ensuring a clear data structure and reducing complexity.

### Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to React</h1>
      <Welcome name="John" />
    </div>
  );
}

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h2>Hello, {props.name}!</h2>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

React is widely used with additional tools like **React Router** for navigation, **Redux** for state management, and **Axios** or **Fetch API** for making HTTP requests.

# React Functional Components with create-react-app or Vite

To get started with a React project, you have two popular options: using `create-react-app` or using `Vite` as the bundler. Both have their strengths. Let's go through each approach step by step with functional components.

---

### **1. Using `create-react-app`**

This is the most commonly used tool to create React apps, especially for beginners. It comes with a lot of built-in configurations to get you started without worrying about Webpack or Babel.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Install `create-react-app`:**
   First, open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   Replace `my-app` with your project name.

2. **Move into the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Create Functional Components:**
   Now, let's create a simple functional component inside `src/App.js`.

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Welcome to My React App!</h1>
         <Message name="John Doe" />
       </div>
     );
   }

   function Message(props) {
     return <h2>Hello, {props.name}</h2>;
   }

   export default App;
   ```

   This will display a simple message with the name passed as a prop.

5. **Run the app:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app. Any changes you make to the code will hot-reload automatically.

---

### **2. Using Vite as the bundler**

Vite is a newer, faster build tool than `create-react-app`. It uses native ES modules and performs very fast builds. If you’re looking for speed and more control over the build process, Vite is a great option.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Install Vite:**
   In your terminal, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-vite-app
   ```
   Select `React` as the framework when prompted, and `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` based on your preference.

2. **Move into the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd my-vite-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Create Functional Components:**
   Just like `create-react-app`, you can create functional components in Vite. Open `src/App.jsx` and modify the code to look like this:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Welcome to My Vite + React App!</h1>
         <Message name="John Doe" />
       </div>
     );
   }

   function Message(props) {
     return <h2>Hello, {props.name}</h2>;
   }

   export default App;
   ```

6. **Run the app:**
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view your Vite-powered React app.

---

### **Key Differences Between `create-react-app` and `Vite`**

- **Performance**: Vite is much faster, especially for development, as it uses native ES modules.
- **Build Size**: Vite generates smaller builds due to its efficient bundling.
- **Ease of Use**: `create-react-app` abstracts a lot of the setup and is perfect if you want to dive into React quickly.
- **Customization**: Vite is more flexible and easier to configure than `create-react-app`.

---

### **Which one to choose?**
- If you are starting out and don’t want to deal with too much configuration, go with `create-react-app`.
- If you are more comfortable with modern tooling and want a faster, more customizable experience, try out Vite.
